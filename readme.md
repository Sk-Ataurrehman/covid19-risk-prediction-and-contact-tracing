# COVID-19 Health Monitoring Application

- The emergence of the coronavirus COVID- 19 switched the limelight onto digital health technologies. To help the infection rates from surging, numerous governments are looking into applications that could help disrupt infection chains beforehand. We created a Self- Assessment Test using COVID Symptoms, that's capable of assessing the threat of COVID- 19 in the user using ML. The data also tracks the user and gives safety tips and recommendations. Using the Track Module, the user is notified of the nearby containment zones. The contact tracing module helps the user to maintain a specified distance from others.

- This application is capable of predicting the risk of getting infected by COVID-19 to the user and the application is developed specifically for the Somaiya Vidyavihar University, the proposed application will be applicable for the students of colleges associated with SVU. The proposed application helps to stop the spreading of COVID-19 within the Somaiya Vidyavihar University and can also alert the users about avoiding the close contacts with others that is maintaining the social distancing with others. We have chosen the Android platform for the development of this project because it is a device that is used by every citizen so we can address large number of people.
